## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/heshamnatouf/heshamnatouf.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
      * Item 2a
      * Item 2b

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/heshamnatouf/heshamnatouf.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
